# Containers, Orchestration & Workflows Special Interest Group

This repository is used to coordinate the Containers, Orchestration & Workflows
Special Interest Group.

## Ask us anything

Does your project involve containers, orchestration solutions (such as
Kubernetes or Vagrant) or workflows and/or workflow management systems? Then you
should come talk to the COW-SIG! We can help you choose the best tools for your
project, and put you in touch with colleagues who have experience with them and
can help you.

To get in touch

- Make an Issue in this repository and label it `help wanted`
- Describe the problem
    - Who is the user?
    - What is the goal they're trying to achieve?
    - Which technical problem needs to be solved?
    - Which technologies are currently in use?

## Tell us anything

Have you discovered, used, or made a new tool in the area of containers,
orchestration, and/or workflows? We'd love it if you shared it with us! This
will help all of us at the eScience Center stay informed on the latest
developments in this field. This can be a full presentation or a live demo or a
quick run-through, it's not a formal thing.

To tell us something

- Make an Issue in this repository and label it `presentation`
- Add a brief description of what you want to show and what it can be used for
